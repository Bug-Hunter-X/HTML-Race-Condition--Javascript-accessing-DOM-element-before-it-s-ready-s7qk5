# HTML Race Condition Bug
This repository demonstrates a race condition bug in HTML where JavaScript attempts to access and modify a DOM element before the browser has fully parsed and rendered it. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the modification failing silently or causing errors.

## Bug Description:
The bug occurs because the JavaScript code attempts to access the element with the ID 'myDiv' before the browser has finished rendering the HTML.  If the script runs before the element is fully parsed, `document.getElementById('myDiv')` will return `null`, resulting in an error or unexpected behavior. This is a common issue when placing scripts within the `<head>` section or in an inappropriate location within the `<body>`.

## Solution:
The solution involves ensuring that the JavaScript code runs only after the entire DOM is ready. This is typically achieved using the `DOMContentLoaded` event listener or by placing the script at the end of the `<body>` element, just before the closing `</body>` tag.
